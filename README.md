# LoL-Esports-Chrome-Extension
This Chrome extension seamlessly integrates with an API endpoint to provide up-to-date League of Legends matches. With its sleek popup design, you can easily navigate through upcoming matches and even filter to see only matches organized by Riot Games, such as LCS, LEC, Worlds, and more.ðŸ¦‰
## Backend
The backend for this project is hosted in a separate repository: [LOL-Match-Fetcher](https://github.com/netistul/LOL-Match-Fetcher). The backend script fetches and formats match data, saving it to a JSON file. This JSON file is then used by the frontend to display match information.
